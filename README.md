# NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

This was a fun quick project to work on. When I first started building websites, it was diffcult to work with CSS. CSS was often confusing but as I continue to code more, the easier it got.
